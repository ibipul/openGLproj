## Open GL 3D Cubes

This is a very short open GL exposition that has the following
 * a 3D stage with perspective,
 * A camera to view the stage, 
 * Three 3D cubes rotating in synch but arbitrarily.

The programming is in C++ compiled in G++ compiler by GNU and uses OpenGL library calls to setup and render the graphics systems.

*Note: These codes were written as a part of Computer Graphics project in 2nd year 1st semester of M.Tech (CS) in Indian Statistical Institute. Course was taken by Prof. Swagatam Das*

###Files:

--------------

The project contains
 - A C++ code file ( **cube.cpp** )
 - A Make file to compile and link with Open GL ( **Makefile**)

###Running the project:
Make sure your open GL is installed & configured properly, then execute these in the directory the code is residing.
```
make
./cube
```

Course was taken by Prof. Swagatam Das*\r\n\r\n###Files:\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe project contains\r\n - A C++ code file ( **cube.cpp** )\r\n - A Make file to compile and link with Open GL ( **Makefile**)\r\n\r\n###Running the project:\r\nMake sure your open GL is installed & configured properly, then execute these in the directory the code is residing.\r\n```\r\nmake\r\n./cube\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-47995334-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
